  "nostr_explanation": "Nostr is a decentralized, censorship-resistant social media protocol. It allows users to communicate directly without relying on centralized servers, using cryptographic keys for identity and encryption.",
  "nostr_private_key_title": "Nostr Private Key",
  "nostr_private_key_explanation": "A Nostr private key is a secret cryptographic key that proves your identity and allows you to sign messages. It's like a password that gives you access to your account.",
  "nsec_format_explanation": "Private keys are typically formatted as 'nsec1...' followed by a long string of characters. This format makes them easy to identify and use in Nostr applications.",
  "remote_signer_title": "Remote Signer",
  "remote_signer_explanation": "A remote signer is a service that holds your private key securely and signs messages on your behalf. This allows you to use Nostr without storing sensitive keys on your device.",
